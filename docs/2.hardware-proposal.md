## Part 1: Hardware Proposal



### The Scenarios

We've provided three different scenarios that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

The three scenarios you'll be looking at are:

- Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector
- Scenario 2: Retail Sector
- Scenario 3: Transportation Sector

If you look at the pages immediately after this one, you'll see that there's one page for each of these scenarios.

### Hardware Proposal

All of the scenarios involve people in queues, but each scenario will require different hardware. So your first task will be to determine which hardware might work for each scenarioâ€”and then explain your initial choice in a proposal document (see below).

Later, after you've built and tested your application on each hardware device for all three scenarios, you'll review the results and validate or update your initial proposed choices in the proposal document.
